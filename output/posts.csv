0,"100 Healthy Days","I&apos;ve been doing super-well on achieving my 2017 goals so far this year and this is motivating me to achieve as many of them as possible. Goal 1 of my 2017 goals is the same as goal 1 of every other year since I started this in 2012: Get to a healthy weight.



I&apos;ve done a lot over the years to help with this,

- I&apos;ve learned to love vegetables where before I had practically zero veg in my diet, I now have a lot.
- I&apos;ve given up sugary drinks &emdash; I still have the occasional fanta but you can probably count the number of fizzy drinks I have per year on my hands now where before you would have probably needed a super-computer to calculate them. My main drinks now are water and sugarless tea/coffee. Still with milk though. If I want a treat, I&apos;ll get some fruit juice but I try to make that an irregular thing.
- I&apos;ve (mostly) given up heavily processed foods &emdash; I used to be a ready-meal addict, these days I cook a lot more things myself and even when I don&apos;t, I go for quick assembly items which are usually not full of chemicals and e-numbers. In fact there used to be a time where my freezer was full and these days I can go weeks without even opening it.
- For my efforts, I&apos;ve gained weight and now stand at 250lbs which is exactly where I was at the start of my last major attempt to lose weight when I recorded my &apos;Developer on a Diet&apos; YouTube series. As you might imagine, this is tremendously frustrating and makes me wonder if somehow my body works in reverse.

So I&apos;m going to try one more thing before I concede that I must be some sort of backwards alien and drown myself in Big Macs and Oreo milkshakes.

## I&apos;m going to join #100healthydays
 
I&apos;ve got to be honest, I naively thought I&apos;d come up with this myself, I&apos;ve been doing the #100happydays hashtag on instagram for a while now (currently on day 87) and I had the idea of kick starting a new ritual of healthy eating by applying the same logic to health as I did to happiness. So I googled 100healthydays and found that someone beat me to the mark. However, like I have discovered with other dieters, they usually started at a weight below my TARGET weight and indeed, before she began she weighed 196lbs.

Like with my &apos;Developer on a Diet&apos; experiment, I was more interested to find out what this sort of thing would do to a completely sedentary and lethargic person who is seriously overweight.

So my variation on 100healthydays will be a little different and I&apos;ve given myself some specific rules to follow:

### 1: No Processed meats

Now, &apos;processed&apos; is a bit of a vague term, diced chicken is technically processed food so it&apos;s hard to follow this one to the letter, needless to say I&apos;m referring to things like bacon and ham. The point of this is to make sure I know what I&apos;m putting into my body.

### 2: No added sugar

This means that I can&apos;t put sugar in anything but I can eat things that have sugar in already. 100 days without the occasional chocolate bar or doughnut just won&apos;t happen so there is no point in kidding myself. Plus as I&apos;m going to attempt to get close to veganism, I need to give myself a treat sometimes but no more sugar in tea (I&apos;d just quit that anyway), no sugar on cereal and no sugar on fruit.

### 3: At least 2 100% vegan days per week

As I get used to this one (which I&apos;m presuming I will) I will probably increase it to a higher number but at the start of the challenge I want to give myself time to ease into it and I think 2 days is completely manageable.

### 4: At least 1 100% veg meal per day

On days I&apos;m not feeling it, this will be just a bowl of corn flakes but ideally this will be a main meal.

### 5: Be active at least 30 mins a day

I suck at getting out and walking when I&apos;m not in the office and that is something I need to change. I suspect this will get easier as the days progress and will be very hard at the start. I can easily spend 30 mins in VR though and that can be knackering if I do it right.

### 6: Keep a public food diary

I&apos;m using myfitnesspal for my food diary as I&apos;ve used it on and off for years and I find it very useful. I&apos;ll also be posting regular journal posts which will also have a food diary in it.

You can see my MFP diary here: http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/foxleigh81

### 7: Do a weekly health check
At the start of this process I did a health check. This involved checking my weight, body fat percentage, visceral fat and muscle mass. I&apos;ll do this every week, usually on a Sunday unless I forget.

My first health check results will be posted as part of my journal later on.

### 8: No more than 5 cheat meals

As this plan focuses on a healthy lifestyle, I don&apos;t see me doing many of these cheat meals anyway. The only things that would be against the rules would be things like going to McDonalds or having a bacon butty. I&apos;m sure I can live without these things, at least for 100 days so I&apos;m only going to allow myself 5 slip-ups.

### 9: &apos;Junk&apos; food must be home-made (or purchased from a high quality restaurant)

This basically means that I need to get my food from high quality sources, so no more fast food establishments for junk food. If I want pizza I need to either make it myself or go to a good quality pizza restaurant (sorry pizza hut, you&apos;re out).

### 10: Drink at least 2 litres of liquid a day

At the moment I&apos;m pretty bad at getting my liquid intake, I can often go a full day on one coffee and a bottle of water. So my goal is to increase that to something a bit healthier.

## Holding myself accountable

When it comes to my personal health, I&apos;ve got very little will-power, however I don&apos;t like to fail and I certainly don&apos;t like it when those failures are public so I&apos;m going to share my journey over the next 100 days (well 96 days as I&apos;m technically already on day 4 &emdash; sorry, I&apos;ve been ill) on the following places:

This blog will be the place you can receive detailed updates about my progress, I probably won&apos;t post daily but I will post as often as possible, I&apos;ll also post my journal updates to here which I&apos;ll make sure I do at least a few times a week.

Instagram is where I&apos;ll be the most prolific as to be a part of the #100healthydays hashtag you need to post to it daily. So expect a lot of pictures of meals and the great outdoors and maybe as the days pass, some progress photos too.

YouTube will be where you can watch any videos I make. I have attempted to do a video blog of diet progress before but that was on an old YouTube account, however if you are interested, you can still watch those here.

Finally, as I mentioned earlier, I&apos;ll also be keeping a public food diary on MyFitnessPal, so you can keep tabs on me there.

## If I fail

Rules are no good unless there are consequences to failing them. So should I not make it to the end of the 100 days or if I have more than 5 meals that break the rules then I need to pay a price. That price will be a £150 donation to the Conservative party. I&apos;m very anti-tory and I&apos;d actually feel sick knowing that I helped them so that&apos;s a big penalty for me.

I&apos;ve got some moral support from my lovely wife as she is joining me on my journey but any support you can give me will be great too, every little helps!

1,"2012 Goals: How did I do?","[Last year I set myself a few life goals](/mind-body-and-soul/2012-not-the-end-the-beginning/ ""2012: Not the end, the beginning!"") and whilst I didn't do too badly, I did not do anywhere near as well as I wanted to, this year I have some different goals and a continuation of some of the same ones. Let&apos;s see how this year plays out.



So how did I do at last years goals? Here is a run-down:

**Reach target weight of 155lbs: Semi-failed** Annoyingly I'm only about 2lb lighter than this time last year, however I am quite considerably thinner as I've managed to replace a fair amount of the fat with muscle. I'm still no where near the fitness level I want to be though and although I am thinner, I'm still a big lad and I&apos;d like that to change.

**Attend martial arts classes: Technical ****Success** I DID attend a martial arts class, I went for about three months until the cost became prohibitive. However it did become almost enjoyable. I probably won&apos;t attend another class this year as I intend to focus more on body toning than weight loss and I feel that the gym will be more than enough for that.

**Set up a sustainable recycling system: Success and fail at the same time** My system is not much different than it was last year, I've added an extra bin for compost-able waste but that&apos;s about it. However I've gotten a lot better at organising it, each bin has a different place in the kitchen now and I manage it quite well.

**Get a hidden litter tray for puddles (My Cat): Success due to moving the goal-posts.** The original intention was to get a hidden litter tray, however I instead managed to [find one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Omega-Paw-Rolln-Cleaning-Litter/dp/B0002DK2DU/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1357133539&sr=8-16) which was REALLY easy to maintain, whilst it&apos;s not hidden, it looks a lot tidier than the old one I had and it never smells.

**Buy some plants: Success** I now have a mini herb garden on my windowsill which I manage to kill completely every few months, however the plants are cheap and easy to replace so I still count it as a win.

**Buy new shelves: Success** I now have some really nice &apos;[Billy bookcase](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S79893865/#/S49858180)&apos; shelves from Ikea which have solved my storage problem and then some.

**Find a way to make more space and I want a new desk: Success** I worked out that I never use my kitchen table so I converted it into a desk which freed up a lot of space in my flat, I am about to move though and I can&apos;t take the table with me so both of these points are now moot.

**Attend at least two college courses: Utter Failure** I stopped attending the one course I was on and never picked another up. However again, the goals changed a little here, once my course finished myself and a few friends on that course decided to start our own writing group which has proven to be of great value to me.

**Read one book per week : Close but no cigar** I have managed about two books per month, however I've been reading some quite long books this year (including some very difficult reads) so I still consider this a reasonable achievement.

**Finish either Emily Bell, The Ghost of you or preferably; both: Fail** I've been terrible at writing this year, the first half I did really well and made some great progress, [I wrote a short story called Harry&apos;s Song](/scribblings/harrys-song-and-the-power-of-free/ ""Harry&apos;s Song and the power of free"") which is the first story I've ever managed to finish, however I've not written anything on my novels since September. This will change in 2013 though.

**Learn to Drive: Complete and total failure** I never made any progress on this goal at all.

**Begin learning an instrument: Technical success.** I bought a ukulele and inherited an electric keyboard. I did begin to start playing the former but I'm still terrible and I've not touched it in months.

 

So I didn't do TERRIBLY but I made no where near as much progress I wanted to. I'll be making a new goals list soon so let's see how I do this year!",2013-01-02 00:00:00.000,2022-01-31 16:36:40.314,null, 1, 1 ,true, ,"Last year I set myself a few life goals and whilst I didn't do too badly, I did not do anywhere near as well as I wanted to, this year I have some different goals and a continuation of some of the same ones. Let&apos;s see how this year plays out."
2,"2012 Goals - Progress so far [FEB]","I've not exactly made leaps and bounds with my 2012 goals but I have made some progress and they are coming along nicely. Here is what I have done so far:



## Health

I am still going to my martial arts classes, I have now officially signed up after my trial ended and I'm looking forward to receiving my white belt next week, I also have a black belt but that came free with a pair of jeans so I doubt they will let me wear it. Even after only three weeks I can already feel a great deal of difference, if I ignore the fact that I am constantly aching, I feel much better than I did when I started, my fitness level has already noticeably increased, if my progress continues at this rate then I have do doubt that by the time this year ends I will have the body I  have wanted to have for most of my life.

I have also invested in a set of weights and a pull-up bar, I've noticed that outside of my classes I am only using the cross-trainer and - as my legs are generally aching like crazy from the kick boxing - I do not use that as much as I should, my arms and upper body generally feel OK after the work out though so I have decided to work on those as well.

## Environment

I have assessed the space available to me in my apartment and drawn the conclusion that it's just not enough, as I love my apartment dearly and have no desire to move I have decided to rent some storage space instead. I managed to get a pretty good deal from [safestore.co.uk](http://www.safestore.co.uk/) who got me 16sq feet of storage for just under £30 a month so before this month is over I will have managed to get a fair bit of rarely used stuff out of my apartment.

I am also preparing some items I no longer need for sale on eBay, hopefully the extra money this will bag me will be enough to buy me my shelves with a bit left over to save up for a new desk.

## Mind

Emily Bell is coming along nicely, I have just passed the 10k word threshold and I believe that if I persevere I can get the first draft finished within 5-6 weeks. I have also just started a group on facebook for like-minded locals who wish to read their work to a group and hear the work of others to meet up weekly. This is to fill the void that will be left behind once the writing course has finished but mainly to provide us with a bit of a 'deadline' feel to our writing so we are not tempted to slack off. Three members of my course (myself included) all have stories that I would very much like to see brought to conclusion and I believe this group will be a big help in achieving that.

In terms of attending another class after my creative writing one has finished, I will probably not do this for a while. The martial arts lessons are quite expensive and I'm not sure I can really afford another class on top of it, plus there is still the chance that the advanced creative writing course will go ahead and I'd like to keep myself free for that.

 

Actually now, I've written it down, I'm made quite good progress, I'm impressed with myself!",2012-02-01 00:00:00.000,2022-01-31 16:36:40.314,null, 1, 1 ,true, ,""
3,"2012: Not the end, the beginning!","There are a lot of posts on the Internet at the moment about the Mayan prophecies and all that rubbish, I have no doubt that life will go on after 2012 and I want it to be better than it currently is.



For most of my adult life I have been into the idea of self improvement and as a result I have acquired a great many skills over the years. However since becoming single for the first time in my adult life in mid-2010 I decided to switch my self improvement focus from learning fun new skills to loftier goals with a view to making some real changes to my life, I have already made some good progress with these changes but this year I am going to go all out into achieving as many of my goals on the list below as I possibly can.

I have divided the list into categories as each category focuses on a different area of my life:

## Health

Self explanatory really, my goal here is to improve the condition of my body. As pretty much every one of my friends tell me, I am very unhealthy and need to do something about it. I am currently 220lbs which is considerably lighter than this time last year but still far from light enough. Plus I want to tone up a little and increase my general fitness.

### Goals for this category:

#### Reach target weight of 155lbs

As I mentioned above, I am quite overweight, whilst I&apos;m not massive (although I have been there) I am determined to make this year the year I _really_ make a change in my life so instead of just getting to a point where I don&apos;t look like crap, I want to get fit. The main way I'm doing it is through improving my diet, I've been using [My Fitness Pal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) for a while now which has contributed to nearly all the progress I've made so far. Getting down to my ideal body weight is only step one though.

#### Attend martial arts classes

Becoming fighting fit is step two. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m never going to be an exercise addict, ever. I don&apos;t really enjoy it enough. I attended my first kickboxing class tonight and whilst it was a lot of fun, it was still work. Plus I have no desire to be ripped, I don&apos;t need a six-pack or biceps that could punch through a bus. I&apos;d just like to look better than I do now and live longer than I will if I continue as I am.

## Environment

By &apos;environment&apos; I don&apos;t mean the world and it&apos;s plethora of issues (although they are included). The aim of these goals is to improve my immediate environment, IE: My Apartment.

### **Goals for this category:**

#### Set up a sustainable recycling system

I _do_ currently have a recycling system, this is it:

![My recycling 'system'](images/recycling.jpg ""My recycling 'system'"") 

Whilst I'm sure this is a better effort than what quite a lot of people manage, it suffers from one fatal flaw; it is disorganised, when things are not perfectly organised, I fail at them. So my goal is to really organise my recycling system so it still fits into the same space but works around me. My apartments bin store does not have any option for separating paper, metal and plastics but it does have a compost bin so I also want to start collecting waste to be composted.

#### Get a hidden litter tray for puddles (My Cat)

This is Puddles, she is - by far - my favourite thing in my life:

![Puddles the cat!](images/image03.jpg ""The be all, the end all"") 

Unfortunately, she comes with one big downside, she has a digestive system, which means I have to have a litter tray, now there are two flaws to having a litter tray in an apartment:

1. There is nowhere to put it where it isn't in the way and unsightly.
2. The smell.

Number two can only be fixed by being a better cat owner and scooping more often than I do (which I plan to do) however number one is really starting to grind my gears, so I need to find a cheap and straightforward way to hide my litter tray but still make it easily accessible to my fluffy little flatmate.

#### Buy some plants

No brainer really, plants look nice, plants smell nice. I want both of those qualities present in my flat. I read [this](http://www.plant-care.com/apartment-plants-5-easy-care-houseplants-for-a-touch-of-nature.html) [article](http://www.plant-care.com/apartment-plants-5-easy-care-houseplants-for-a-touch-of-nature.html) last summer which gave me some good ideas. Still not quite gotten around to it yet though.

#### Buy new shelves

I love books and I love movies, whilst my movie collection is gradually going digital, I still have a great deal of DVD&apos;s and even more books. My book cases have not only run out of room but have even started to sag, lean and warp. New ones seem to be quite expensive if you want anything decent so that may require some saving.

#### Find a way to make more space

My apartment is far from a penthouse but considering what I pay for it, it&apos;s a pretty good size, I&apos;ve looked at apartments which were tiny compared to mine and cost the same (or more in some cases), however I have a lot of stuff and I seem to need it all, somehow I need to find a way to make some more space. Particularly because:

#### I want a new desk

This is my desk at the moment:

![my desk](images/image01.jpg ""yes that&apos;s Puds again, she likes to sit on my arm as I try to type"")

This was the desk I had before I moved here :

![My old desk](images/image02.jpg ""God I miss this desk"")

In order to get this apartment I had to get rid of my desk and sell two of my monitors and my PC speakers. As a novel writer, blogger, PC gamer and web developer it was very frustrating going from three monitors to one and I seriously over estimated my ability to cope with that and to work on a desk the size of a chopping board.

## Mind

I&apos;m quite a clever guy (if I do say so myself), this is largely due to the years of learning new things and absorbing information wherever possible. My goal is to continue on this path and increase my educational input as much as possible.

### **Goals for this category:**

#### Attend at least two college courses

This one is pretty much in the bag to be honest, I&apos;ve already started an intermedia [creative writing course](/scribblings/creative-writing-course/) and when this finishes, I plan to do the advanced course as well. I may even fit a third course in if I have the time.

#### Read one book per week

I actually read quite a lot, however I&apos;ve read a few challenging books lately (one of which took me three months to finish - and by finish I mean say &apos;sod this&apos; and put it back on my shelf), I&apos;m currently reading two books, &apos;[Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&apos;](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0749397357/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=filteredreali-21&link_code=as3&camp=2506&creative=9298&creativeASIN=0749397357) by Roddy Doyle and &apos;[The Hound of the Baskervilles](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/014043786X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=filteredreali-21&link_code=as3&camp=2506&creative=9298&creativeASIN=014043786X)&apos; by Arther Conan Doyle. I&apos;m finding the former interminably dull (actually that&apos;s a lie, there were a few parts which were moderately enjoyable) but I am determined to finish it, however I find myself reaching for Sherlock much more often. Once Paddy Clarke is finished, I&apos;m going to commit myself to reading one book a week. To do this I&apos;ll stick with lighter books, if I want to read Plato again, I&apos;ll do it alongside another, much more enjoyable book.

#### Finish either Emily Bell, The Ghost of you or preferably; both.

I&apos;m currently writing two novels (titles above). The latter I have just started this week and the former I&apos;ve been writing for about four months. I&apos;ve made a lot of progress on Emily Bell but not nearly as much as I should have done. I am going to start by committing to writing at least 30 minutes a day and try to get in at least an hour. If I can write 1000 words a day, I will be happy with that.

#### Learn to Drive

It is my great shame that at thirty years old, I still cannot drive. This year will be the year I finally pass my test. Of course, living in the middle of Leeds city centre, I&apos;ll probably not find a use for a car for a while but at least I&apos;ll have the skill when I need it.

**Begin learning an instrument**

Last year a couple of friends of mine attempted to teach me how to play the guitar, I learned a few bars of &apos;Smoke on the water&apos; and then stopped. I have since acquired an electric keyboard as well as an electric guitar so I am determined to learn how to play at least one of those, preferably the keyboard so I can piss my sister off who has been practising for years.

## GO, GO, GO

I will be keeping you all up to date on these goals, not only telling you how I&apos;m doing but also what I&apos;ve done, so if any of you decide to attempt similar endeavours, you will have some help. At the end of the year I&apos;ll go through this list again and see how I measured up.

If anyone has any (helpful) suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment :)

4,"2021 Goals","2020 was not a year of succeeding in my goals. I don't share a lot of peoples high hopes for 2021, so these goals will be 'pandemic appropriate'



## 1) Maintain a sustainable weight loss... continued

Last year, I didn't manage to achieve any weight loss, in fact I ended the year 0.6lbs heavier. This year, I really hope to change that. Before lockdown hit, I was on track to lose around 1/2lb a week, if I can continue that this year I can potentially lose almost 2 stone, which would be great. I'm not setting that as a target, I'm just sticking to the goal of sustained (and sustainable) weight loss.

## 2) Get my finances in order ... continued

This one is something of a tall order as we are saving to get some house renovations done, which means getting rid of my credit card debt isn't really the highest priority, I'm still going to put some money towards it though so hopefully I'll be able to make some headway, if I have managed to knock 50% off the balance by the years end, I'll consider this a win.

I also want to do some serious financial detoxing and sort my budget out properly. Time to be a grown-up with money, finally. That also means I need to stop my frivolous spending, I've got enough 'stuff' and it looks like I'm not going on holiday any time soon so I really don't need to be spending as much as I am.

## 3) Write more

So as you can probably see by the dates on my previous blog posts; I've not been writing much lately. I run a few other blogs and I've written a little bit more on them but still not very much. My goal is to do at least one post per month on average on each blog. I'd also like to get back into my fiction writing. Finishing my first draft of Emily Bell would be great but any non-fiction writing that I actually complete a draft of will do for me to consider this a success.

## 4) Launch a software project

I've been a coder for decades now and I must admit, my love for out of hours coding has diminished considerably over the years. I want to rectify that a little bit this year though, I've had some really cool projects in my head for a while and I'd like to get at least one of them done this year. Even if it doesn't make me any money, I'll at least have another project to talk about with clients which is always a good thing.

---

That's it for this year. I'd love to think that I'll be able to get some more home renovations done or start attending the gym more often but I'm afraid I don't really have a huge amount of faith that we'll get our 'normal' lives back any time soon, we might be lucky in the back end of the year but I'm not even sure about that prospect. So the goals above feel like they are achievable even if I can't leave my home for the next 12 months. Check back in 2022 to see how I got on!",2021-01-05 00:00:00.000,2022-01-31 16:36:40.314,null, 1, 1 ,true, bg-pos-right,""
