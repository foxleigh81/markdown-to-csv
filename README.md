# markdown-to-csv
A script to convert a collection of markdown files to csv format for use in Strapi.

Please note: This is specific to my use case, where I have a collection of markdown files with frontmatter that I want to convert to csv. It does not output things like categories, specific authors, etc. However it's a 'good start' file that you're welcome to modify to your own needs.
