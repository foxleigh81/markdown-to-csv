2020 was not a year of succeeding in my goals. I don't share a lot of peoples high hopes for 2021, so these goals will be 'pandemic appropriate'

<!-- end -->

## 1) Maintain a sustainable weight loss... continued

Last year, I didn't manage to achieve any weight loss, in fact I ended the year 0.6lbs heavier. This year, I really hope to change that. Before lockdown hit, I was on track to lose around 1/2lb a week, if I can continue that this year I can potentially lose almost 2 stone, which would be great. I'm not setting that as a target, I'm just sticking to the goal of sustained (and sustainable) weight loss.

## 2) Get my finances in order ... continued

This one is something of a tall order as we are saving to get some house renovations done, which means getting rid of my credit card debt isn't really the highest priority, I'm still going to put some money towards it though so hopefully I'll be able to make some headway, if I have managed to knock 50% off the balance by the years end, I'll consider this a win.

I also want to do some serious financial detoxing and sort my budget out properly. Time to be a grown-up with money, finally. That also means I need to stop my frivolous spending, I've got enough 'stuff' and it looks like I'm not going on holiday any time soon so I really don't need to be spending as much as I am.

## 3) Write more

So as you can probably see by the dates on my previous blog posts; I've not been writing much lately. I run a few other blogs and I've written a little bit more on them but still not very much. My goal is to do at least one post per month on average on each blog. I'd also like to get back into my fiction writing. Finishing my first draft of Emily Bell would be great but any non-fiction writing that I actually complete a draft of will do for me to consider this a success.

## 4) Launch a software project

I've been a coder for decades now and I must admit, my love for out of hours coding has diminished considerably over the years. I want to rectify that a little bit this year though, I've had some really cool projects in my head for a while and I'd like to get at least one of them done this year. Even if it doesn't make me any money, I'll at least have another project to talk about with clients which is always a good thing.

That's it for this year. I'd love to think that I'll be able to get some more home renovations done or start attending the gym more often but I'm afraid I don't really have a huge amount of faith that we'll get our 'normal' lives back any time soon, we might be lucky in the back end of the year but I'm not even sure about that prospect. So the goals above feel like they are achievable even if I can't leave my home for the next 12 months. Check back in 2022 to see how I got on!
